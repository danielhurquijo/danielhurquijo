                 <p>I am interested in understanding how discriminatory laws come to be. While extensive research has highlighted their harmful effects on society, we still know surprisingly little about why such policies emerge in the first place. To tackle this question, I focus on two canonical examples of state-sponsored discrimination: apartheid in South Africa and Jim Crow in the American South. As part of my work, I am developing some exciting new datasets, including election results from South Africa (1910–1994), the complete set of laws passed by Southern states (1870–1920), and White area declarations during apartheid.</p>
                 
                 <p>During my PhD I have helped organize the Comparative Politics Seminar Series and the Occassional Political Economy Seminar Series at the EUI. I was also a Teaching Assistant for the graduate-level Causal Inference course.</p>
                 
                 <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree from the University of Liverpool and a Master's degree from King's College London, both in political economy.</p>

      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Why does transitional justice fail to consolidate democracy? While scholars and practitioners routinely assume that transitional justice has a democratizing effect, little evidence supports this claim. We problematize this relationship, arguing that political incentives distort the adoption, design, and behavior of transitional justice, eventually prioritising the interests of implementing parties over democratic ideals. We test our argument on a unique record of transitional justice behavior: full-text amnesty decisions from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Controlling for an extensive set of covariates, we find that decisions consistently and uniquely favored members of the African National Congress (ANC) while punishing their direct political opponents, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). Groups without formal representation in post-apartheid politics, such as the apartheid apparatus or non-ANC anti-apartheid organizations, did not experience differential treatment. Our findings suggest that, once set up, implementing parties use transitional justice institutions to target political rivals, which may include the preceding regime, but not necessarily.
